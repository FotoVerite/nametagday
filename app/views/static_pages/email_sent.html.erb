    <div class="poem">"One is often deceived in love, often wounded, often unhappy ; but one loves, and on the brink of the grave one turns to look back and says : I have suffered often, sometimes I have been mistaken, but I have loved. It is I who have lived, and not a spurious being bred of my pride and my anxiety, my boredom and my sorrow."<br> - Alfred de Musset</div>
