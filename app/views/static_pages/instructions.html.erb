 <h2>Nametag Volunteers</h2>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <p class="c6"><span class="c10">Volunteers write names on nametags and
  distribute them with a smile.</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <h3>What will I do?</h3>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <p class="c6"><span>- Show up to your location 20 min. early. Look for a Station Coordinator (SC), who will be wearing a smiley face hat.</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <p class="c6"><span>- Smile at passerby and say, &ldquo;Hi! Would you
  like a free nametag? It&rsquo;s Nametag Day, we're trying to get New Yorkers to talk to
  each other more.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <ol class="c5" start="1">
    <li class="c7 c6"><span>If they say</span> <span class=
    "c3">YES</span><span>,</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c6 c9"><span>&nbsp; 1. Write the person&rsquo;s name (can be nickname or any
  non-obscenity) on a nametag</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c9"><span>&nbsp; 2. Remove the sticker backing and dispose of the backing
  in your trash bag</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c9"><span>&nbsp; 3. Hand the nametag sticker to the person</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c9"><span>&nbsp; 4. Remind participants to please dispose of their
  nametags in the trash and not litter</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c9"><span>&nbsp; 5. Follow with, &ldquo;&#8203;We encourage you to talk to
  anybody wearing a nametag, or really anybody at all. We're trying to get New York to be
  a friendlier place for the day.&#8203;&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <p class="c6"><span>Feel free to continue speaking with the person a bit if neither of
  you is in a hurry. If they&rsquo;re interested in joining for NTD 2014, take down their
  name and email or phone number and send it to hello@nametagday.com. They won&rsquo;t be
  spammed.</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <ol class="c5" start="1">
    <li class="c7 c6"><span>If they say</span> <span class="c3">NO</span><span>&nbsp;say,
    &ldquo;Thanks anyway. I hope you have a great day.&rdquo;</span></li>
  </ol>

  <ol class="c5" start="1">
    <li class="c7 c6"><span>If they ask</span> <span class=
    "c3">WHY</span><span>&nbsp;say, &ldquo;So that we take a day to notice how we relate
    to people around us.&rdquo;</span></li>
  </ol>

  <ol class="c5" start="1">
    <li class="c6 c7"><span>If they</span> <span class="c3">DEBATE</span> <span>but are
    still listening, say &ldquo;Okay, well try taking the day to notice how you relate to
    (or interact with) people and see what you think.&rdquo;</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c6 c8"></p>

  <p class="c6"><span>- Once the shift is done, return any remaining supplies to your SC
  and spend 5 min. cleaning up any NTD-related trash at the distribution site.</span></p>
